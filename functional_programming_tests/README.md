# functional_programming_tests

This directory contains examples of tests that do and do not follow functional programming principles. When working with ROS, it is tempting to follow the established paradigm of encapsulating code and associated data in classes that inherit from or are composed of `rclcpp::Node`. This usually leads to the code being dependent on the ROS ecosystem to function, even when it is not needed. In `without_functional_programming.cpp`, there is class method that requires testing, `generate_global_path`. To test the method properly, an entire ROS2 pipeline must be spun up. Writing all this extra code can be time consuming and lead to bugs in testing. In `with_functional_programming.cpp`, the `generate_global_path` method is now a free function, and the `costmap_callback` and `get_costmap` functions aren't needed anymore. This leads to less boilerplate code required to test `generate_global_path`.
